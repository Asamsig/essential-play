Essential Play


Getting Started:

  Grunt is installed, if not you'll need to install Node and most likely brew, good luck.
  Grunt - http://gruntjs.com is used to drive pandoc to build various content types - html, pdf and epub.

  You'll need to install the grunt project dependencies the first time you check the project out:

   npm install

Building books:

  grunt pdf
  grunt html
