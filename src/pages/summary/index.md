# Summary

Through the course of this book we have introduced you to
the main systems used to build web applications in Play:

 -  In Chapter 2 we introduced the basic HTTP request/response cycle
    and showed you how to configure routes, controllers, and actions
    to handle incoming requests.

 -  In Chapter 3 we added HTML and HTML forms to the mix.
    We showed you Twirl templates as a means of producing HTML,
    and the Play forms library that provides type-safe conversions
    between incoming form data and Scala values.

 -  In Chapter 4 we took a diversion from web sites and showed you
    how to create JSON REST APIs in Play. Many modern web applications
    either contain APIs or are built completely on web services,
    and Play doubles as a fast, efficient API server.

 -  In Chapter 5 we introduced async programming and concurrency,
    and introduced you to the client side of calling web services
    via Play's WS library.

Hopefully you now have an appreciation of the speed and simplicity
of creating web sites, APIs, and microservices using this
simple, flexible web framework.

There are many more topics to cover, including web sockets, database access,
XML processing, and more. Unfortunately this is only a single book and
we have to stop somewhere. For further reading we will refer you
to the following excellent resources:

 -  [The Play documentation][docs-root] is the best starting point for
    looking at other parts of Play, including web sockets and comet.

 -  [The Underscore Gitter channel][link-underscore-gitter] is a great
    place to ask questions about this book, the content and exercises within.
    Post here to chat directly to the authors and other readers.

 -  [The Play Google Group][link-play-google-group] is another great place to
    get help with Play. The Play community and committers are friendly
    and often willing to help out.

 -  [sbt-web][link-sbt-web] is the emerging ecosystem for compiling and bundling
    browser-side resources using SBT. Check this out if you want to make heavy use of
    browser-side technologies such as Javascript, Coffeescript, Less CSS, and SASS.

 -  [Scala.JS][link-scalajs] is an amazing Scala compiler that targets
    Javascript. Check this out if you're looking to write browser-side
    code in Scala!

 -  [Peter Hilton's *Play in Action*][link-play-in-action] is another
    good book on Play if you're looking for
    a different author's take on the framework.

 -  [Underscore's Advanced Scala with Scalaz][link-advanced-scala-scalaz]
    is a great resource if you're looking to level up your Scala and learn
    about advanced functional programming concepts such as monads, functors,
    and applicatives.

Thank you for reading this book. We hope you had as much fun reading it as we did writing it,
and we hope it armed you with the knowledge to write Play applications with confidence.
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please get in touch on Gitter or
email the authors at [hello@underscore.io](mailto:hello@underscore.io?subject=Essential%20Play).

All the best, and happy coding!
