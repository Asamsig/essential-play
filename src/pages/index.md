This book is aimed at developers wanting to get started writing web services using the [Play](http://playframework.com) 2 web framework. The material presented is specifically written for Play version 2.3, although the concepts introduced are applicable to any version of Play 2.

Over the course of the book we will build a simple chat application using a service-oriented architecture, with different parts of the application residing on different servers and communicating over HTTP. By the end of the book, the reader should have a foundation in the following subjects:

 - Routing, controllers, and actions
 - Manipulating requests and responses
 - Reading/writing JSON data
 - Asynchronous request handling
 - Calling external web services
