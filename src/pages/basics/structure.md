## Directory Structure

Play projects use the following directory structure,
which is quite different to the standard structure of an SBT project:

~~~ bash
root/
 +- app/        # Scala application code
 |   |
 |   +- assets/ # client assets for compilation by SBT
 |              # (Javascript, Coffeescript, Less CSS, and so on)
 |
 +- views/      # Twirl templates for compilation by SBT
 |
 +- public/     # static assets to be served by the application
 |              # (HTML, Javascript, CSS, and so on)
 |
 +- conf/       # runtime configuration files bundled with the
 |              # deployed application (route config, logs, DB config)
 |
 +- test/       # Scala unit tests
 |
 +- logs/       # logs generated by the development server
 |
 +- project/    # configuration files and temporary files
 |
 +- target/     # temporary directory used to store completed builds
~~~

Most of our time in this book will be spent editing
Scala files  in the `app` and `test` directories
and the `routes` configuration file in the `conf` directory.
You can find out more about [the asset directories](docs-assets) and
[configuration files](docs-config) in the Play documentation.
