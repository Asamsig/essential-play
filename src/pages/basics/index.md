# The Basics

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this chapter we will introduce five fundamental concepts used to process web requests in Play: *actions*, *controllers*, *routes*, *requests*, and *results*. With these concepts we will be able to:

 - write simple *actions* that respond to *requests* and produce corresponding *results*;
 - bundle *actions* together into convenient modules called *controllers*;
 - associate *actions* with URLs using *routes*;
 - inspect *requests* to extract useful information such as URIs, headers, and content;
 - construct and manipulate *results*, including status codes, headers, and content.

In this chapter we will introduce five fundamental concepts used to process web requests in Play: *actions*, *controllers*, *routes*, *requests*, and *results*. With these concepts we will be able to read incoming HTTP requests, pass them to the correct module of application code, extract appropriate information, and send a response back to the client.
