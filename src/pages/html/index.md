# HTML and forms

In the last chapter we saw how to receive HTTP requests and send responses. However, we dealt exclusively with content of type `text/plain`. In this chapter we will generate HTML content using Play's templating language, *Twirl*. We will also learn how to create HTML forms and parse and validate submitted form data.
