At the time of writing, the following features are missing:

1.  A summary chapter.
    This will include a condensed discussion of
    everything we have covered in the book together with
    some closing thoughts on application structure
    and service oriented architecture.

2.  An additional exercise on `Futures` in Chapter 5,
    covering async responses without using the web services API.

3.  Documentation of the running "chat" exercise.
