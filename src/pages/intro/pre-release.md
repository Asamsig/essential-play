There are two major things missing from this version of the book:

First, we need a summary chapter.
This will include a condensed discussion of
everything we have covered in the book together with
some closing thoughts on application structure and service oriented architecture.

Second, we need to weave the exercises from
the Essential Play training course through the text of the book.
We currently have a complete set of exercises for Chapter 3,
but the remaining content chapters need fleshing out with their own exercises.

The code for the exercises and solutions is distributed as a ZIP file with the book.
You can also clone the exercises from our Github repo.
See the next chapter for details.
