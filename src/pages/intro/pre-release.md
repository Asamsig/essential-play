There are three major things missing from this version of the book:

First, we need a summary chapter. This will include a condensed discussion of everything we have covered in the book, together with some closing thoughts on application structure and service oriented architecture.

Second, we are considering including a short primer on SBT for those who are new to Scala and Play.

Third, we need to weave the exercises from the Essential Play training course through the text of the book. The current format is one extended exercises per chapter, although we will probably weave in smaller exercises as well. You should have received the code and solutions for the exercises in a ZIP file with this text. The exercises should be fairly self-explanatory---let us know if you have any questions!
